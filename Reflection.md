Working on this project helped me understand how Python concepts fit together when building a complete program. I learned a lot about using classes to structure my work and how methods inside a class make the code much easier to follow. I also discovered the importance of helper methods. Before this project, I didn’t really think about breaking repeated tasks into smaller functions, but using helper methods for things like input validation and printing made the program cleaner and prevented me from writing the same code in multiple places. I also strengthened my understanding of inheritance by using separate classes for income and expense transactions.

One of the biggest challenges I faced was flow control. At the beginning, it was confusing to manage how the program should move from one action to another, especially inside the menu. Sometimes the program would run in a way I didn’t expect, and it took a while to trace what was happening. Another challenge was understanding how everything connects inside the BudgetTracker class and when to use 'self'. I also struggled with keeping the balance accurate after undoing a transaction, because removing one item meant updating the state of the whole program. Getting all these parts to work together required a lot of testing and adjusting.

If I had more time, I would improve the program by adding file storage so that the user’s data is saved even after closing the program. I would also try to make the output more organized, maybe with aligned columns or coloured text to make it easier to read. Another idea would be adding optional limits or spending warnings to help users manage their budget better. Overall, this project helped me grow more confident with flow control, helper methods, and structuring programs in a clear and modular way.
